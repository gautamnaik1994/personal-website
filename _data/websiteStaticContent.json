I'm interested in all kinds of visual communication, but my major focus is on designing web interfaces, mobile interfaces, and frontend web development.\n\nI also have skills in other fields like user experience, branding, icon design, and game development. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, beautiful and intuitive designs.\n\nMy career began in August 2015 as a Junior Designer, and I’ve arrived as a UI Designer & Frontend Developer focused on crafting clean & user‑friendly experiences.\n\nAs a Frontend Web Developer, my toolset includes HTML/CSS, Javascript, ReactJS, JSX, Bootstrap, Foundation, Webpack, Gulp, NPM and Git.\n\nAs a Designer, I have experience in diverse areas of the development process, including prototyping, UX/UI design, and user needs research.\n\nBeing both Designer and a Developer, gives me added advantage in the form of more control over the interface designs and their implementations.\n\n<!--EndFragment-->",

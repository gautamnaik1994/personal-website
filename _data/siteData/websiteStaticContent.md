With over **8 years** of experience as a **Software Engineer**, I have a proven track record of delivering high-quality user interfaces that are intuitive, responsive, and visually appealing. I am proficient in implementing frontend systems using the latest technologies, such as **ReactJS, NextJS, Redux, Typescript, JavaScript, ES6, and CSS**.

I collaborate effectively with UX/UI teams and stakeholders to translate functional specifications into seamless user experiences. I prioritize building interfaces that are both aesthetically pleasing and highly functional, emphasizing usability and accessibility.

What sets me apart from others is my working knowledge of backend technologies, such as **Python, NodeJS, Fast API, MySQL and DynamoDB**. I am also proficient in building serverless applications using **AWS Lambda** and deploying them using **AWS Cloud Development Kit**.

Overall, I am a detail-oriented engineer with a passion for creating exceptional user experiences that meet the highest standards of quality and performance.

I'm a **Designer & Front-end Developer** with 6 **years** of professional experience. I'm interested in all kinds of visual communication, but my major focus is on designing web interfaces, mobile interfaces, and frontend web development.

I also have skills in other fields like user experience, branding, icon design, and game development. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, beautiful and intuitive designs.

My career began in August 2015 as a Junior Designer, and I’ve arrived as a UI Designer & Frontend Developer focused on crafting clean & user‑friendly experiences.

As a Frontend Web Developer, my toolset includes HTML/CSS, Javascript, ReactJS, JSX, Bootstrap, Foundation, Webpack, Gulp, NPM and Git.

As a Designer, I have experience in diverse areas of the development process, including prototyping, UX/UI design, and user needs research.

Being both Designer and a Developer, gives me added advantage in the form of more control over the interface designs and their implementations.

I'm a professional **Designer & Front-end Developer** with **7 years** of experience in the industry. My passion is creating visually appealing and user-friendly web and mobile interfaces, as well as developing them with the latest web technologies.

I have a diverse skill set that includes user experience, branding, icon design, and game development. I love solving complex problems with simple, elegant and intuitive solutions.

I started my career in August 2015 as a Junior Designer, and I have grown into a UI Designer & Frontend Developer who focuses on delivering clean & userâ€‘friendly experiences.

As a Frontend Web Developer, I use HTML/CSS, Javascript, ReactJS, JSX, Bootstrap, Foundation, Webpack, Gulp, NPM and Git as my tools of choice.

As a Designer, I have experience in various stages of the development process, such as prototyping, UX/UI design, and user needs research.

Being both a Designer and a Developer gives me an edge in terms of having more control over the interface designs and their implementations.
